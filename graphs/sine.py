Sin functions can be used in audio synthesis, trigonometry,
filter coefficients, LFOs and saturation algorithms.

In audio synthesis, errors will result in aliasing, making
high precision is necessary. If the radians can be controlled
to be within -/+ π, then the pade & sin_approx functions are
great choices. If not, the mineiro_full function may be okay
here, although the aliasing in your use case should be
analysed before deciding to use it.

High precision is also needed in generating filter
coefficients, so again the pade & sin_approx functions may
be good choices, however it should be tested how much they
effect the cutoff.
For displaying a magnitude graph of a filters cutoff, you
may be able to get away with the very fast functions. The
inputs to sin functions are often well below π which is
where these approximations are most accurate. The func
mineiro_faster is likely a great choice, and perhaps juha,
however their errors should be plotted before using them.

In trigonometry for graphics, the fast juha algorithm yields
fantastic speed. It is bad after +/- π, however most right
angle triangle trig only uses angles less than 90deg. The
accuracy of wildmagic0 is also great for right angle
triangles.

LFO's can also take advantage of the fast juha algorithm.
Often a sine LFO is implmented as:
    sin(-pi + phase_0_to1 * 2pi);
This is so the phase can easily be cycled by using:
    phase_0_to1 += inc;
    phase_0_to1 -= (int)phase_0_to1;
The sin function easily remains within +/- π bounds, making
juha a great choice.

In saturation, error will result in different tones, so you
should experiment with the sound of different funcs that suit
your needs. For cycling funcs, mineiro_full_faster and
juha_fmod should work great.

The following table compares the speed and error margin of
different sin approxiamtions used in the following formula:
